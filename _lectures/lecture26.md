## Problem Session 26 â€“ Practice Questions

_{{ page.released-on }}_

Extra Credit
- Attend the beginning of lecture for an ungraded 20 minute quiz for a research study.
- Note: please try to attend your registered lecture to ensure we have enough seating for eveyone.

The same team that gave the ungraded quiz on the first day of lecture is doing another quiz
to complete their research study. We will give all participants at lesat 1% extra credit.

We do not do any grade rounding, so this will be your only opportunity to move up a grade
if you are on the boundary (i.e. 92.5% would become 93.5% if you do the extra credit moving 
from an A- to an A).

There is no pre-lecture video. Either come to lecture or watch the podcast.

Readings (to be completed **before** problem session). 
- No Stepik readings

Videos (to watch **before** problem session):
- No videos
